3. Open one of the sketches in the [live example](https://thankful-river-0462fc303.1.azurestaticapps.net/).
4. Paste the API Key in the password field & click *Connect*.
5. Have two friends join the [live example](https://thankful-river-0462fc303.1.azurestaticapps.net/) and let them each choose another sketch.
6. Send them the API key so they can connect as well.
7. Play around with the sketches and see what happens!
